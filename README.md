# StringEncoder
The goal of this work is to implement the function ```NODE* encode(NO* word)``` responsible for receiving a non-empty linked list with up to 500 elements representing a phrase- Each node of the list represents a character. In the end, the function should return the encoded version of the phrase provided, following two steps:

1. Invert each sequence of non-vowels, including white spaces and punctuation
2. Invert the whole linked list and return the response


Example:

- After first step: TO LEARN DATA STRUCTURES IS SO COOL
- After second step: LOOC OS SI SERUCTU STRATARN DAEL OT
